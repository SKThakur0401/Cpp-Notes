    <p>
        Now, what if u want to apply changes in some container tags and not in others... like u want one paragraph tag to be blue and other to be red... the external CSS sheet would affect all the 'p' tags... so to handle that... we can create our own class :) ...
    </p>

    <p class="blueMaker">
        We wrote class = "blueMaker"   ,,, blueMaker is a class in our CSS folder so which ever container will have class= "blueMaker" will be affected by the code in that CSS file
        <br>
        see the CSS code,
    </p>

    <h3>
        Now for this tag we didn't apply our class
    <h3>


    <h3 class= "blueMaker cursive"> Here we added 2 classes simultaneously, we just had to write their names adjacent... </h3>
