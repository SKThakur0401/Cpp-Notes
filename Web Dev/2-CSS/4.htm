I have specified what the 'p' tag should do (within style container tag) ...             ""now the 'p' tag will do what the last command to it will be given""  here the 'style' tag is the last command so it will follow it! ... but! if the 'p' tag has some inline commands given to it, Then it will follow the inline commands!!! coz it will be the last command given to it-->
