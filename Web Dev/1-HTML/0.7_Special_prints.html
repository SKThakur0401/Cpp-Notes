<!-- Here we r gonna learn how to print things which we won't be able to print under normal circumstances because the computer might confuse it to be a part of the code -->

<!-- for example... printing "</head>"   -->

<!-- to print these special characters we need to put them between " &; " -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            Tools
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h3>Hi I know I can print &lt;&Backslash;h3&gt;</h3>  <!--SO, IF U NEED PRINT THINGS
             LIKE BACKSLASH OR GREATER THAN OR SMALLER THAN SYMBOL,
             U CAN'T SIMPLY DO THAT, U NEED TO FILL THE ENTITY BETWEEN....    &;    -->


        <p>Ye karke dikhao!!!   &lt;&Backslash;head&gt;</p>
        <p>Ye karke dikhao!!!   &lt;&Backslash;title&gt;</p>
        

        <p>hi my name is      Saumya    Kumar    Thakur</p>

        <!--   Note: no matter how many spaces u put b/w texts... only one space would be printed on the html page... coz the html language ignores all blank spaces!!!  So to make it notice... we need to put it like this  "  &nbsp;  " nbsp stands for: no-break-space    -->

        <p>hi my name is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saumya  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kumar &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thakur</p>
