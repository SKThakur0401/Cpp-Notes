            <!-- Here we used "value" attribute, which sets the default "input" in that field as the value given... ie. "India" here... u can change the value obviously its just the default value (but u can't change it if changes are disabled which can be done using "disable" attribute :)-->

            <!-- You know, "required" attribute stops you from keeping that input area empty... similarly "disabled" attribute stops you from making any changes in that field -->
