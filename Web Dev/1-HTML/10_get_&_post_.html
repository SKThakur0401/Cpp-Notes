<!-- "get" and "post" are two methods in form   remember the syntax of form ....   "    <form action="" method=""    "   ... now in "method" we can fill 'get' or 'post'  ... both are used to connect to the server....  -->  

<!-- In "get", the data collected in the 'form' will be simply given to the server...and no changes will be made in the server (changes like deleting something or editting something...) -->

<!-- "post" the data is sent to the server and some changes may be made in the server like some editting deletion etc.... -->

<!-- NOTE: "post" is more secured than "get" ... so use 'post' when sharing sensetive information -->

<!-- When u use "get".. whatever data you enter  in the form becomes a part of the 'URL' !!  -->


<!-- WHAT DOES "action" DO??

    ANSWER : IT SPECIFIES THE ADDRESS ON THE SERVER TO WHICH THE FORM CONTENT IS TO BE SENT
