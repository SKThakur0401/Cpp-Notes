<!-- Blocks tag like "h1", "h2"...6, "p", "div" etc occupy an entire line, even though the text written inside them may be small, it doesn't matter, it's gonna consume an entire line!! -->


<!-- Inline tag doesn't consume an entire line... e.g. "img" tag, if the images are small they might be placed on the same line... (if the 2 img tags are not separated by a "br" or any "block" tag that is :) -->

<!-- Examples of inline tags include...  "img", "<b>"(for bold text), "<strong>" ('strong' and 'b' does the same thing) , "<i>", <u>, <sub> (for subscript), "<sup>" for superscript...   "<q>" for quoted text..(text will be within double quotes!)  -->
