// Bipartite graph : A graph which can be colored using two ("Bi") colors, such that all directly connected nodes have alternate colors!!

// NOTE: All linear graphs (i.e. a graph having no cycles) are bipartite graph! (Check urself!)

// NOTE: Any graph with "odd-length-cycle" i.e. a cycle that has length which is ODD (like 3,5,7..)  can never be a bipartite graph! (Check urself!)

// So how will we find to whether a given graph is "bipartite or not ??"

// Solution is simple.... (do urself first...) we will use BRUTE FORCE APPROACH, we will start filling the graphs with alternate colors and if a point comes where we can't fill two adjacent nodes with different colors then we say that its not a bipartite graph :)
