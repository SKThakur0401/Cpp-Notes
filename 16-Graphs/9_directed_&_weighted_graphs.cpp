// Just watch the ' 3-minute '  video, on "23.Lecture 17 Graphs"

// It will tell you about "directed graphs",  in which if you have a path from   "a to b" , doesn't mean you have a path from "b to a" ....( so minor change in our graph would be... we used to do "arr[f][s]=1 as well as arr[s][f]=1" ,  now here, the first one doesn't necessarily imply the second, so we will not do the        "arr[s][f]=1")


// "Weighted graphs" are graphs where two vertices are connected, but there's weight/ distance between them, which can be different for different vertices
