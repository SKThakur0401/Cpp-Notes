// Polymorphism means a single entity behaving in different ways in different scenarios
// We want this polymorphism bcoz we want the same function to behave differently for different entities...  example :  " 2+3 " adds the two number, but -- 'a'+'b' -- will add the ASCII value of the two numbers this is an example of "polymorphism", same operator is behaving differently :)


// 2 types of polymorhism : "Compile time polymorphism"  &  "Run time polymorphism"

// Compile time polymorphism has two types> 
// i > function overloading : Remember we create multiple constructors for a class... a constructor with no parameter, another with one parameter, another with two.... this is example of function overloading, just like this we can create a function with 0,1,2,3... etc parameters, similary in inheritance... a base class can have a function called say "print" , it possible that its child class will also have a function called "print" ...this is also example of function overloading


// ii> operator overloading : We did this in OOPS only...,  another example :  " 2+3 " adds the two number, but "  'a'+'b'  " will add the ASCII value of the two numbers so this is example of operator overloading, same operator is performing different task in different scenarios :)

// FUNCTION OVER-RIDING : When a function is created by the base class and the same function is created by its child class.... that is called function over-riding.. we have over-ride the function in base class :)
