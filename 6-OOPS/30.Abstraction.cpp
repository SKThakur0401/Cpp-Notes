// Abstraction: Hiding of unnecessary / irrelevant data from the user, e.g. we use in-built sort function for various things, but we don't how it is sorting, so that is data abstraction

// Encapsulation : Bundling of data in a single unit, for example we create "class" for data encapulation, we create various functions of a class which can be used on objects of that class only.... this helps us achieve "data abstraction & and security/protection"
                            // OR
// store data in a container, (classes are used for encapulation, various data can be stored in a capsule :)
