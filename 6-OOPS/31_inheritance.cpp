If accessModifer is : 

    PUBLIC:
    public--> public
    protected--> protected
    private--> X (cannot be inherited)


    PROTECTED:
    public--> protected
    protected--> protected
    private--> X (cannot be inherited)

    PRIVATE:
    public--> private
    protected--> private
    private--> X (cannot be inherited)

    NOTE: if we do not mention any access_modifier, by default it is "private"
